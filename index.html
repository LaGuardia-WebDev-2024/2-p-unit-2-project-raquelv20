    <p id="about-the-park">
      The park is a fictional place that is the main setting of the Cartoon
      Network show <em> Regular Show.</em> The main place to go to in the park
      is Pop's House which you will find in the center of the park. Features of
      Pop's house include Mordecai and Rigby's room, Pop's room, the roof, the
      computer room, and the kitchen.

    <h3>Getting around</h3>

    />
    <p id="golf-carts">
      The main method of transportation in the park is a golf cart. Your tour
      guides of the park will be <strong class="mordecai">Mordecai</strong> and
      <strong class="Rigby">Rigby</strong>. Mordecai is a blue jay bird and
      Rigby is a racoon. Although their main jobs are groundskeepers they have
      no problem helping you find your way around.

    <h3>Things to do</h3>

    />
    <p class="m-and-r">
      As long as Mordecai and Rigby are your guides there will never be a dull
      moment. Although they both have jobs at the park working is something you
      will rarely see them do. Many of their excursions include learning Death
      Kwon Do, traveling to the moon with a magic keyboard, prank calling the
      Master Prank Caller, chugging 'brain juice', and eating so much junk food
      Rigby's body detached itself from him leaving him as a bodiless
      consciousness.
